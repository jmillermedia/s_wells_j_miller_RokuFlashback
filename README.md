## Description:
This project will span both semesters of the Authoring class. You will design and prototype the functionality in the fall semester and build the app in the final Winter semester. 

You will build an audio / video app in the Authoring class, using queries and database assets that you’ll be compiling (or have compiled) in the Advanced Web class. Create assets based on the Roku Flashback brief (to be supplied) to create the layout, views and components you will be working with. 

This project requires two roles - designer and developer. Because there are usually more of one than the other, you’ll have to adapt to the demands of the project throughout its lifecycle. In other words, approach this as a true team - the designer might have to help with some code challenges, and vice versa. 

Use the MAMP/WAMP/LAMP stack (Mac/Windows/Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP) for the server side and Vue.js as your front-end framework. You can use your movie API that you did in the Web class or your back end. You’ll have a couple of endpoints set up, queries written etc; you’ll need to expand on those and adapt it to work with AJAX / JavaScript. 

A user should be able to log in, filter and select a movie, tv show, or audio based on user profile (adult or kids). This means that you’ll have to restrict access to some content based on age or ratings, and your users will need rights and priveleges as well. The UX / UI should update based on the user (children / adults) - create 2 themes, and render the appropriate theme on login. 

Part of the API that you’re building should allow a user to comment on the selection, rate it, and share via social media.

## Assignment Requirements:

No particular installation required. Download repo and open in a code editor. Content will require a Live Server to view properly (MAMP/WAMP/Docker). Database will need to be loaded into local phpMyAdmin.
